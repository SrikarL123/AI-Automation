# Event Registration Automation

An automated event registration workflow built using Zapier to streamline participant onboarding, verification, and backend tracking.

This project demonstrates how real-world event registration processes can be automated using no-code tools to reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and enhance user experience.

---

## 🔹 Project Overview

The Event Registration Automation system handles event registrations submitted via Google Forms. Once a participant submits the form, the system automatically:

- Generates a unique registration ID
- Sends a professionally formatted confirmation email
- Embeds an inline QR code containing participant details
- Applies conditional logic for online/offline events
- Logs registration data in Google Sheets for real-time tracking

This setup closely mirrors how registrations are handled for college events, workshops, webinars, and conferences.

- Google Form–based event registration  
- Automated HTML-formatted confirmation emails  
- Unique registration ID generation  
- Inline QR codes embedding participant details  
- Conditional workflows for online/offline events  
- Real-time backend tracking using Google Sheets

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **Zapier** – Workflow automation and logic handling  
- **Google Forms** – User registration interface  
- **Gmail** – HTML-formatted automated emails  
- **Google Sheets** – Backend data storage and tracking  
- **QR Code API** – Dynamic QR code generation

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

1. A participant submits the event registration form.
2. Zapier triggers the automation workflow.
3. A unique registration ID is generated.
4. Conditional logic routes the workflow based on event type (Online / Offline).
5. A confirmation email is sent containing:
   - Registration details  
   - Unique registration ID  
   - Inline QR code with participant information  
6. All registration data is logged in Google Sheets with timestamps for tracking.

## ⏱️ How This Project Is Helpful & Time-Saving

This automation removes the need for manual coordination during event registrations by:

- Eliminating manual confirmation emails  
- Preventing duplicate or missing registrations  
- Automatically generating and tracking unique participant IDs  
- Enabling quick participant verification using QR codes  
- Providing real-time access to registration data  
- Scaling easily for large numbers of participants  

What typically requires hours of manual work can now be completed automatically within seconds.
